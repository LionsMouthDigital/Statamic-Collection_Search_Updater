# Statamic-Collection_Search_Updater

Automatically update a collection's search index when an entry is saved

NOTE: 
- Must select the collection in the addon settings
- Only accepts one collection right now (open an FR issue if you want more than one)
- and you must make sure the collection is set up for indexing per the [Statamic Docs](https://docs.statamic.com/search#collection-indexes)
